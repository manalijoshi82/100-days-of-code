# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 04, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Worked on my first project on freecodecamp- Random Quote Machine.

**Thoughts:** Quickly worked through the HTML, CSS part and moved on to JS. Getting a random quote on a click was not really too hard. But I struggled a bit with the tweet button.

### Day 2: January 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent solving some programming challenges on coderbyte.

**Thoughts**: My first introduction to coderbyte challenges. They surely are making me build my algorithm skills.


### Day 3: January 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued  coderbyte challenges today.

**Thoughts** It's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.


### Day 4: January 07, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the local weather app @freecodecamp challenge

**Thoughts** HTML, CSS part was really straighforward. It started getting a little bit confusing when things got into API's and AJAX. Need to go through that part one more time. Time for backing up a little bit in order to move forward. The project is still in progress, not finished yet.

### Day 5: January 09, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Went through the API's and AJAX portion of the freecodecamp certification. As well as watched a few videos to get a little deeper understanding of these really important concepts. 

**Thoughts** Didn't really code much but got better understanding of API's and AJAX parts of the puzzle.


### Day 6: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Signed up for #javascript30 challenge by Wes Bos. Finished the day 1 project- Drum kit. 

**Thoughts** Had super duper fun finishing the drum kit project. Learned a lot of new things today.
- data- attribute and how to use it.
- a few new HTML5 tags like KBD, audio and used them for the first time
- learnt ES6 template strings which basically takes JS expressions and substitute it for a variable and even more.
- used document.querySelector for the first time.

All in all a very productive day. I was happy to finish the project.

### Day 7: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the clock project as a part of javascript30 challenge. 

**Thoughts** The clock project was fun learning experience. Used ES6 template strings today as well. had some math expressions. I still have a little trouble getting the glitch out at the 60th second. Will keep working on that.


### Day 8: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Flex panel image gallery project as a part of JS30 challenge. 

**Thoughts** Today I did a lot of flexbox and a little of js just to hook things up. I did take a few flexbox tutorials in the past, and so it was a little easier to get hang of flex in today's project. I need to dig deep into transition property. I am thinking about signing up for the flexbox series by Wes Bos.
- I totally enjoyed the cool css part of the project.
- I loved the interactivity, and the cool effects that the transition bought into the game.

Will soon put the link to the project.


### Day 9: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: jQuery course on codeacademy

**Thoughts** Needed to solidify some jquery events and DOM manipulation.
I realised while working on FCC's wikipedia viewer project that I need to solidify my understanding of DOM manipulation. So I went through the jquesy material one more time, pause and understand it very well so that I can apply my knowledge to the FCC projects further.
I came across some really cool jquery effects that I want to put it to use and build something cool and interactive as one of my coding days out of 100.

### Day 10: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a simple to do list on codepen

**Thoughts** While learning jquery events I thought I should build a simple to do list where I can apply what I learnt.
In this process I learnt how to use reset method in jquery to empty the imput box after the item gets added into the list. It's a javascript method which if you want to use in jquery, you will have to convert into object and then access like an array.
I further want to modify my the todo list with features like-
- Hitting enter should add the item to the list.
- may be add a dropdown for days of the week and then add the items to that particular days.

and even more.....

### Day 11: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on array methods from #javascript30 challenge

**Thoughts** Today's exercise was challenging one. I used methods like sort, reduce, map and filter to solve some algorithmic problems. I am sure I will have to keep coming back to todays lessons again in the future.

I came across console.table() method that tabularize the data in your console for better analysis.



### Day 12: January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Hold shift and check checkboxes from #javascript30 challenge

**Thoughts** Followed Wes's video throughout for this one. I don't think I was ready to do this one on my own. I am still not done with the whole exercise. I have to get a deeper understanding of some of the code. Dindn't really feel confident to put an end to this. So I am keeping this open and will come back to it in future.


### Day 13: January 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Wikipedia Viewer

**Thoughts**  WOW!! What a day!! Finally finished my wikipedia viewer from the freecodecamp's track. Have been working on it bits and pieces at a time. Finally today I got through the ajax part. Added DHTML components to the pictures and the magic started happening. I loved the end result when everything started acting as expected.
I also added error message for when wikipedia didn't have any results.

I also added fadein() to add a little bit of animation effect on the results.

Completely enjoyed working on this one especially the last part when things started working together!

### Day 14: January 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Flexbox Tutorial

**Thoughts** Found a really good resource on flexbox. Spent really good hours today and reached up to alignment video on Wes Bos's flexbox tutorial. flexbox is really a fun and productive way of building websites.

I am totally loving building with flexbox.


### Day 15: January 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Twitch.tv- FCC project

**Thoughts**  I can't believe I am working on the Twitch.tv, which is the intermediate FCC project. After I finish this one I will be done with all the intermediate projects.

Added the link to check if the FCC is online. 

Next steps - pull the data of all the streamers and show if they are online. If they are, then user should be able to display the game they are on and the status. Don't know how I will do it exactly. But one step at a time.

Still not close to where where I want to be for this one but included the link anyway!

### Day 16: January 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Twitch.tv- FCC project

**Thoughts**  Oh...did I say I am working on the twitch.tv for FCC 
It's taking time to grasp of all things ajax. Dynamically asking for data and displaying all up on your web page is no joke it seems!!

### Day 17: January 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a navbar using flexbox.

**Thoughts**  For a change today, I am working on flexbox's nav bar. To give myself a break, here I am to build something quicker and cooler than what I have been doing for last 2 days.

With a few flexbox's key properties, you can turn the nav bar into some magical element on the page which seems like you have shaken up a lot of properties but in reality, just a few key properties and you are good to go.


Wills soon be adding the link when I will set it all up.


### Day 18: January 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: twitch and only Twitch.tv
It's finely coming together. It has taken some time, but I am taking this time really understand the basic building blocks of the project.

Will soon be adding the link when I will set it all up.

### Day 19: January 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Twitch.TV DONE DONE DONE

Got ready with the twitch.tv project. Learned a lot of things from this very important project.
