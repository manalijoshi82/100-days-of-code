# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 04, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Worked on my first project on freecodecamp- Random Quote Machine.

**Thoughts:** Quickly worked through the HTML, CSS part and moved on to JS. Getting a random quote on a click was not really too hard. But I struggled a bit with the tweet button.

### Day 2: January 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent solving some programming challenges on coderbyte.

**Thoughts**: My first introduction to coderbyte challenges. They surely are making me build my algorithm skills.


### Day 3: January 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued  coderbyte challenges today.

**Thoughts** It's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.


### Day 4: January 07, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the local weather app @freecodecamp challenge

**Thoughts** HTML, CSS part was really straighforward. It started getting a little bit confusing when things got into API's and AJAX. Need to go through that part one more time. Time for backing up a little bit in order to move forward. The project is still in progress, not finished yet.

### Day 5: January 09, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Went through the API's and AJAX portion of the freecodecamp certification. As well as watched a few videos to get a little deeper understanding of these really important concepts. 

**Thoughts** Didn't really code much but got better understanding of API's and AJAX parts of the puzzle.
