# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 04, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Worked on my first project on freecodecamp- Random Quote Machine.

**Thoughts:** Quickly worked through the HTML, CSS part and moved on to JS. Getting a random quote on a click was not really too hard. But I struggled a bit with the tweet button.

### Day 2: January 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent solving some programming challenges on coderbyte.

**Thoughts**: My first introduction to coderbyte challenges. They surely are making me build my algorithm skills.


### Day 3: January 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued  coderbyte challenges today.

**Thoughts** It's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.


### Day 4: January 07, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the local weather app @freecodecamp challenge

**Thoughts** HTML, CSS part was really straighforward. It started getting a little bit confusing when things got into API's and AJAX. Need to go through that part one more time. Time for backing up a little bit in order to move forward. The project is still in progress, not finished yet.

### Day 5: January 09, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Went through the API's and AJAX portion of the freecodecamp certification. As well as watched a few videos to get a little deeper understanding of these really important concepts. 

**Thoughts** Didn't really code much but got better understanding of API's and AJAX parts of the puzzle.


### Day 6: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Signed up for #javascript30 challenge by Wes Bos. Finished the day 1 project- Drum kit. 

**Thoughts** Had super duper fun finishing the drum kit project. Learned a lot of new things today.
- data- attribute and how to use it.
- a few new HTML5 tags like KBD, audio and used them for the first time
- learnt ES6 template strings which basically takes JS expressions and substitute it for a variable and even more.
- used document.querySelector for the first time.

All in all a very productive day. I was happy to finish the project.

### Day 7: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the clock project as a part of javascript30 challenge. 

**Thoughts** The clock project was fun learning experience. Used ES6 template strings today as well. had some math expressions. I still have a little trouble getting the glitch out at the 60th second. Will keep working on that.


### Day 8: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Flex panel image gallery project as a part of JS30 challenge. 

**Thoughts** Today I did a lot of flexbox and a little of js just to hook things up. I did take a few flexbox tutorials in the past, and so it was a little easier to get hang of flex in today's project. I need to dig deep into transition property. I am thinking about signing up for the flexbox series by Wes Bos.
- I totally enjoyed the cool css part of the project.
- I loved the interactivity, and the cool effects that the transition bought into the game.

Will soon put the link to the project.


### Day 9: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: jQuery course on codeacademy

**Thoughts** Needed to solidify some jquery events and DOM manipulation.
I realised while working on FCC's wikipedia viewer project that I need to solidify my understanding of DOM manipulation. So I went through the jquesy material one more time, pause and understand it very well so that I can apply my knowledge to the FCC projects further.
I came across some really cool jquery effects that I want to put it to use and build something cool and interactive as one of my coding days out of 100.

### Day 10: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a simple to do list on codepen

**Thoughts** While learning jquery events I thought I should build a simple to do list where I can apply what I learnt.
In this process I learnt how to use reset method in jquery to empty the imput box after the item gets added into the list. It's a javascript method which if you want to use in jquery, you will have to convert into object and then access like an array.
I further want to modify my the todo list with features like-
- Hitting enter should add the item to the list.
- may be add a dropdown for days of the week and then add the items to that particular days.

and even more.....

### Day 11: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on array methods from #javascript30 challenge

**Thoughts** Today's exercise was challenging one. I used methods like sort, reduce, map and filter to solve some algorithmic problems. I am sure I will have to keep coming back to todays lessons again in the future.

I came across console.table() method that tabularize the data in your console for better analysis.



### Day 12: January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Hold shift and check checkboxes from #javascript30 challenge

**Thoughts** Followed Wes's video throughout for this one. I don't think I was ready to do this one on my own. I am still not done with the whole exercise. I have to get a deeper understanding of some of the code. Dindn't really feel confident to put an end to this. So I am keeping this open and will come back to it in future.


### Day 13: January 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Wikipedia Viewer

**Thoughts**  WOW!! What a day!! Finally finished my wikipedia viewer from the freecodecamp's track. Have been working on it bits and pieces at a time. Finally today I got through the ajax part. Added DHTML components to the pictures and the magic started happening. I loved the end result when everything started acting as expected.
I also added error message for when wikipedia didn't have any results.

I also added fadein() to add a little bit of animation effect on the results.

Completely enjoyed working on this one especially the last part when things started working together!
