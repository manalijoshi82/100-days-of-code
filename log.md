# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 04, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Worked on my first project on freecodecamp- Random Quote Machine.

**Thoughts:** Quickly worked through the HTML, CSS part and moved on to JS. Getting a random quote on a click was not really too hard. But I struggled a bit with the tweet button.

### Day 2: January 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent solving some programming challenges on coderbyte.

**Thoughts**: My first introduction to coderbyte challenges. They surely are making me build my algorithm skills.


### Day 3: January 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued  coderbyte challenges today.

**Thoughts** It's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.


### Day 4: January 07, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the local weather app @freecodecamp challenge

**Thoughts** HTML, CSS part was really straighforward. It started getting a little bit confusing when things got into API's and AJAX. Need to go through that part one more time. Time for backing up a little bit in order to move forward. The project is still in progress, not finished yet.

### Day 5: January 09, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Went through the API's and AJAX portion of the freecodecamp certification. As well as watched a few videos to get a little deeper understanding of these really important concepts. 

**Thoughts** Didn't really code much but got better understanding of API's and AJAX parts of the puzzle.


### Day 6: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Signed up for #javascript30 challenge by Wes Bos. Finished the day 1 project- Drum kit. 

**Thoughts** Had super duper fun finishing the drum kit project. Learned a lot of new things today.
- data- attribute and how to use it.
- a few new HTML5 tags like KBD, audio and used them for the first time
- learnt ES6 template strings which basically takes JS expressions and substitute it for a variable and even more.
- used document.querySelector for the first time.

All in all a very productive day. I was happy to finish the project.

### Day 7: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the clock project as a part of javascript30 challenge. 

**Thoughts** The clock project was fun learning experience. Used ES6 template strings today as well. had some math expressions. I still have a little trouble getting the glitch out at the 60th second. Will keep working on that.


### Day 8: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Flex panel image gallery project as a part of JS30 challenge. 

**Thoughts** Today I did a lot of flexbox and a little of js just to hook things up. I did take a few flexbox tutorials in the past, and so it was a little easier to get hang of flex in today's project. I need to dig deep into transition property. I am thinking about signing up for the flexbox series by Wes Bos.
- I totally enjoyed the cool css part of the project.
- I loved the interactivity, and the cool effects that the transition bought into the game.

Will soon put the link to the project.
