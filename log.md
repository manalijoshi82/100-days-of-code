# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 04, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Worked on my first project on freecodecamp- Random Quote Machine.

**Thoughts:** Quickly worked through the HTML, CSS part and moved on to JS. Getting a random quote on a click was not really too hard. But I struggled a bit with the tweet button.

### Day 2: January 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent solving some programming challenges on coderbyte.

**Thoughts**: My first introduction to coderbyte challenges. They surely are making me build my algorithm skills.


### Day 3: January 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued  coderbyte challenges today.

**Thoughts** It's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
